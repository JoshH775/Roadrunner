# Roadrunner – Forza Horizon 5 Lap Time Tracker

**Roadrunner** is a web app designed to help *Forza Horizon 5* players log and organise their lap times across different tracks, cars, and builds. While the in-game leaderboards only display your single best time per track and restrict visibility to players on the same platform, Roadrunner makes it possible to track every run and compare results with friends across systems.

The app was built to fill that gap. Whether you're testing a new car class, tuning setup, or just want to preserve more context around your laps, Roadrunner gives you a flexible way to record and reflect on your driving performance.

_Note: Automatic lap time logging via telemetry was considered early in development. While technically feasible through FH5’s telemetry server and external tooling, it would require a more advanced setup than this project currently supports. Roadrunner instead focuses on a reliable, manual entry experience that's accessible to most players._
